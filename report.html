      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Within this report, I shall be discussing a number of topics such as my
        experience with this module, how I found the development, design and
        debugging of this assignment. Furthermore, I shall discuss issues that
        had arisen during the development of my portfolio and how these issues
        were debugged and fixed. Finally, I shall also include screenshots and
        links to images and sites that influenced by design decisions.
      </p>
      <h1 id="term">Development over the term</h1>
      <p>
        Coming to the university, I already had a lot of prior experience with
        web technology and I had worked on large projects however, I had little
        knowledge on the history of the web and how it came to be what it is
        today.
      </p>
      <h2 id="index">Index page</h2>
      <p>
        So firstly, I began creating my index page which would essentially just
        be the homepage, I chose to include my name in the centre of the page, a
        navigation bar across the top of the page which would span the entire
        width of the page. I chose to include the navigation bar at the top of
        the page rather than anywhere else as it is very common among most
        website and would therefore, be more intuitive to the users.
        Furthermore, I also wanted to include a background video Redfield, J.
        (2019) with a slight blur or an opaque layer. In the end I chose to use
        the background video as it seems to appear a lot in modern web pages and
        adds a lot more character especially for web pages with minimal content.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/images/indexDesign.PNG" alt="Index page design" />
      <figcaption>Figure 1 - Index page design</figcaption>
      <p>
        I selected my colour scheme using a website called
        <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>. I wanted to have a dark
        colour scheme as it is a lot easier on the eyes. A light theme looks
        professional and trustworthy however, I chose not to implement that at
        this stage. At a later stage I could implement a switch so users can
        chose if they want a dark or light theme or by using the CSS
        prefers-color-scheme feature to detect the users browser theme.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/images/palette.png" alt="Colour palette" />
      <figcaption>Figure 2 - Colour theme I selected</figcaption>
      <p>
        For the footer design, I chose to pick my primary colour as it provides
        a nice contrast between the dark grey. I also made the text within the
        footer the darkest grey within my colour palette as it would contrast
        with the bright primary colour. Additionally, I made the text bold as it
        was quite small and I still wanted it to stand out as if the text size
        was increased.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/images/footer.PNG" alt="Footer design" />
      <figcaption>Figure 3 - Website footer design</figcaption>
      <p>
        For my entire website, I used the Roboto font as it is easily readable
        and is very popular. Furthermore, it is developed by Google which means
        that it is developed with care and regularly maintained.
      </p>
      <h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio page</h2>
      <p>
        Moving on to the portfolio page, as it was necessary that columns were
        used on the page, I decided to use a grid that consists of three columns
        by two rows to contain each one of my modules. This also meant that when
        it came to making the design responsive, it would be a lot easier as I
        could simply change the size of the grid to two columns and three rows
        which proved to work very well as is seen in both Figure 4 and Figure 5
        below.
      </p>
      <img
        src="./assets/images/portfolioDesktopDesign.PNG"
        alt="Portfolio desktop design"
      />
      <figcaption>Figure 4 - Portfolio desktop design</figcaption>
      <img
        src="./assets/images/portfolioMobileDesign.PNG"
        alt="Portfolio desktop design"
      />
      <figcaption>Figure 5 - Portfolio mobile design</figcaption>
      <p>
        The images within my portfolio page which can be seen in the figures
        above were taken from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>,
        which is a website that offers free stock images that you can use within
        your projects. I tried to find images for each module which suited the
        topic at hand for example, problem solving and programming being
        represented as a Rubik's cube or computer systems as a circuit board.
        Originally, each module div element was using the CSS
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter"
          >backdrop-filter</a
        >
        property however, when I began validating my web pages, I realised that
        this property's status was, "editor's draft" which meant that I
        unfortunately couldn't use it as the CSS validator would show it as
        being unrecognised. My solution to this problem therefore was to add a
        darkened film to the background of the div element so that the image was
        darker and the foreground text would contrast better as it is white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each module within the portfolio page is a clickable element which
        displays a fullscreen information element containing more details about
        the given module. However, I don't think that it is very clear to the
        end user that they have to click the module. Additionally, the only
        current way for the user to exit the fullscreen element is by clicking
        the back button within their browser which also is not very intuitive.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/images/portfolioFullscreen.PNG" alt="Fullscreen module information">
      <figcaption>Figure x - Fullscreen module element</figcaption>
      <h2 id="mobilenav">Mobile navigation</h2>
      <p>
        For the mobile responsive design of my website, I chose to simply have a
        medium sized burger menu in the top right of the screen as it seems to
        be most conventional and is quite inituitive. This burger menu that I
        have implemented is the same design across all of the pages as expected
        and when the burger menu is clicked a navigation screen transitions into
        the viewport as is seen in the figure below.
      </p>
      <img
        src="./assets/images/mobileNavigation.PNG"
        alt="Mobile navigation design"
      />
      <figcaption>Figure 6 - Mobile navigation design</figcaption>
      <p>
        Unlike the desktop navigation, the mobile navigation covers the entirety
        of the viewport. The links within the navigation bar are positioned in a
        vertical fashion from top to bottom and the navigation can be exited
        using a red exit button in the top right of the screen. I chose to place
        the exit button here as it is the same position where the burger menu
        icon is located and therefore, would make sense to the user.
      </p>

        validate (HTML and CSS).
