    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Within this report, I shall be discussing a number of topics such as my
      experience with this module, how I found the development, design and
      debugging of this assignment. Furthermore, I shall discuss issues that
      had arisen during the development of my portfolio and how these issues
      were debugged and fixed. Finally, I shall also include screenshots,
      links to images and sites that influenced by design decisions.
    </p>
    <h1 id="term">Development over the term</h1>
    <p>
      Coming to the university, I already had a lot of prior experience with
      web technology and I had worked on large projects however, I had little
      knowledge on the history of the web and how it came to be what it is
      today.
    </p>
    <h2 id="index">Index page</h2>
    <p>
      So firstly, I began creating my index page which would essentially just
      be the homepage. I chose to include my name in the centre of the page, a
      navigation bar across the top of the page which would span the entire
      width of the page. I chose to include the navigation bar at the top of
      the page rather than anywhere else as it is very common among most
      website and would therefore, be more intuitive to the users.
      Furthermore, I also wanted to include a background video Redfield, J.
      (2019) with a slight blur or an opaque layer. In the end I chose to use
      the background video as it seems to appear a lot in modern web pages and
      adds a lot more character especially for web pages with minimal content.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/indexDesign.PNG" alt="Index page design" />
      <figcaption>Figure 1 - Index page design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I selected my colour scheme using a website called
      <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>. I wanted to have a dark
      colour scheme as it is a lot easier on the eyes. A light theme looks
      professional and trustworthy however, I chose not to implement that at
      this stage. At a later stage I could implement a switch so users can
      choose if they want a dark or light theme or by using the CSS
      prefers-color-scheme feature to detect the users browser theme.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/palette.png" alt="Colour palette" />
      <figcaption>Figure 2 - Colour theme I selected</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      For the footer design, I chose to pick my primary colour as it provides
      a nice contrast between the dark grey. I also made the text within the
      footer the darkest grey within my colour palette as it would contrast
      with the bright primary colour. Additionally, I made the text bold as it
      was quite small and I still wanted it to stand out as if the text size
      was increased.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/footer.PNG" alt="Footer design" />
      <figcaption>Figure 3 - Website footer design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      For my entire website, I used the Roboto font as it is easily readable
      and is very popular. Furthermore, it is developed by Google which means
      that it is developed with care and regularly maintained.
    </p>
    <h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio page</h2>
    <p>
      Moving on to the portfolio page, as it was necessary that columns were
      used on the page, I decided to use a grid that consists of three columns
      by two rows to contain each one of my modules. This also meant that when
      it came to making the design responsive, it would be a lot easier as I
      could simply change the size of the grid to two columns and three rows
      which proved to work very well as is seen in both Figure 4 and Figure 5
      below.
    </p>
    <figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/portfolioMobileDesign.PNG" alt="Portfolio desktop design" />
      <figcaption>Figure 5 - Portfolio mobile design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The images within my portfolio page which can be seen in the figures
      above were taken from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>,
      which is a website that offers free stock images that you can use within
      your projects. I tried to find images for each module which suited the
      topic at hand for example, problem solving and programming being
      represented as a Rubik's cube or computer systems as a circuit board.
      Originally, each module div element was using the CSS
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter">backdrop-filter</a>
      property however, when I began validating my web pages, I realised that
      this property's status was, "editor's draft" which meant that I
      unfortunately couldn't use it as the CSS validator would show it as
      being unrecognised. My solution to this problem therefore was to add a
      darkened film to the background of the div element so that the image was
      darker and the foreground text would contrast better as it is white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each module within the portfolio page is a clickable element which
      displays a full screen information element containing more details about
      the given module. However, I don't think that it is very clear to the
      end user that they have to click the module. Additionally, the only
      current way for the user to exit the full screen element is by clicking
      the back button within their browser which also is not very intuitive.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/portfolioFullscreen.PNG" alt="Full screen module information">
      <figcaption>Figure 6 - Full screen module element</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="mobilenav">Mobile navigation</h2>
    <p>
      For the mobile responsive design of my website, I chose to simply have a
      medium sized burger menu in the top right of the screen as it seems to
      be most conventional and is quite intuitive. This burger menu that I
      have implemented is the same design across all of the pages as expected
      and when the burger menu is clicked a navigation screen transitions into
      the viewport as is seen in the figure below.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/mobileNavigation.PNG" alt="Mobile navigation design" />
      <figcaption>Figure 7 - Mobile navigation design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Unlike the desktop navigation, the mobile navigation covers the entirety
      of the viewport. The links within the navigation bar are positioned in a
      vertical fashion from top to bottom and the navigation can be exited
      using a red exit button in the top right of the screen. I chose to place
      the exit button here as it is the same position where the burger menu
      icon is located and therefore, would make sense to the user.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contact">Contact page</h2>
    <p>
      For my contact page, I chose to put my contact form on the left side of the page and make it around 20% of the
      page's width as a massive form would be very excessive and would not be an effective way to fill the space. I was
      then faced with the dilemma of what I would put in the empty space of the page, this is when I thought about adding
      a Google map embed as this would fill the page. I searched for the university campus on Google Maps and then
      embedded it on the page. The embed I used is on line 67 of my contact.html file Google. (2020).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/contactFig.PNG" alt="Contact page">
      <figcaption>Figure 8 - Contact form design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Furthermore, when I first added the map embed, I realised that the light theme of the map did not fit in with my
      theme at all and therefore, I used the filter property to invert the colours of the map to make it more dark
      themed. For the form action, I added code so that when the submit button is clicked, the user's email client will
      be opened with my email address automatically inserted so that they can contact me.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/formAction.PNG" alt="Form action code">
      <figcaption>Figure 9 - Form action code</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="cv">CV page</h2>
    <p>
      While I was looking for inspiration I stumbled across a very attractive design TrueThemes. (2020). In figure 10,
      you can see the design that inspired my own design for my CV page. I placed a picture of myself on the left side
      of the page with an overlay with my full name, role and additional links to my social media accounts. For the
      social media links, I added icons Material Design. (2020) which I selected as the icons fit in very well with the
      purpose of each of the three links.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/niko-resume-cv-website.jpg" alt="CV design inspiration">
      <figcaption>Figure 10 - CV design inspiration</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      On the right side of the page, I added all of my information such as my description, work experience and
      education. I chose to highlight all of the headings using my primary colour as I believe they are important and
      therefore, deserve the user's attention. I did face one issue on my CV page however, where the footer of the page
      would seem to float into the middle of the page although, this only happened on mobile. After some time debugging
      the issue, I deduced that the issue occurred due to the body being 100vh in height, which meant that the footer
      could not exceed the height. To fix this issue, I set the height of my body to auto only on mobile devices which
      seemed to resolve my issue.
    </p>
    <h2 id="report">Report page</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, the report page was the last page I created. Once I had created the base of page (contents, sections,
      figures and references) it was quite easy to add to the report. When I began, I already knew how I would format
      the file validation which was within a grid as I could easily resize the grid for different screen resolutions. I
      wanted to make my report as similar as I possibly could to an actual word document, for this reason, I chose to
      create a div within my body which would contain all of the report content. This also meant that I could simply set
      the overflow of the div to auto so that while I added more content to my report, the scroll bar would appear
      automatically and the user would be able to simply scroll through the report without running into any issues with
      the footer or other page content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I wanted to implement a working table of contents, so I designed a solution in which I use anchor
      tags for the table of contents and within the href attributes I added the ids of the headers so that when they
      are clicked, the page would automatically scroll down to the relevant heading with the use of the target selector,
      this can be seen within figure 11.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/images/tableOfContentsCode.PNG" alt="Table of contents code">
      <figcaption>Figure 11 - Table of contents code</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Spacing all of the content was an easy task with the use of margins and padding, I added a margin-bottom to my
      paragraphs to space them apart and so that when I created a new heading, there was enough space between the last
      paragraph of the previous section and the new heading as seen in figure 12.
    </p>

      validate (HTML and CSS).

    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      In conclusion, the overall assignment was very enjoyable and I feel like I have learned a lot from it despite
      having previous experience. For the last section of my report, I will outline issues with my end product and
      describe ways which I could use to resolve the issues if given the opportunity. Furthermore, I will also describe
      the strengths of my website and what makes it stand out.
    </p>
    <h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
    <ul class="sw-list">
      <li>The website has an attractive design which uses a consistent colour scheme</li>
      <li>All of the pages of the website are uniform in design and do not digress</li>
      <li>Animations have been used to make the website appear more professional and interesting</li>
      <li>The website is fully responsive for all devices</li>
      <li>Navigation of the website has been customised especially for mobile devices</li>
      <li>Website code is formatted well which makes it more maintainable</li>
      <li>All files pass validation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
      <p>Now within this section, I shall discusses the weaknesses of the website and possible solutions.</p>
      <h3>Modules tabs on the portfolio page do not have an exit button</h3>
      <p>This issue could be resolved easily by implementing an exit button. This button would simply be an anchor tag which would have an empty href attribute.</p>
      <h3>Animation on the portfolio page causes the page to lag</h3>
      <p>I have looked into this issue already and I know that it can be solved by changing the animation delay on all of the module tiles.</p>
      <h3>The contact form does not send the data automatically</h3>
      <p>This will be resolved by implementing a backend API endpoint which will send the email automatically using PHP.</p>
